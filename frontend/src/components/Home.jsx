      <p className='w-[80%] m-auto text-center'>BMI, or Body Mass Index, is a simple numerical value derived from a person's weight and height. It helps categorize individuals into weight groups such as underweight, normal, overweight, or obese. Calculated as weight (kg) divided by height (mÂ²), BMI is widely used in health assessments. Though convenient, it doesn't account for muscle mass, age, or gender differences.</p>
